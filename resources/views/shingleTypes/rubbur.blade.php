    <p>
        Hi-Tek Rubber, Inc. manufactures a line of shingles that is marketed and sold by RuBBurâ„¢
        Concepts. RuBBur shingles are compression-molded shingles made from recycled tires. The primary 
        material is EPDM, a rubber that is resistant to extreme high and low temperatures. The shingles, 
        available in 2 colors, are formed into textured panels that resemble slate and cedar shake shingles.  
    </p>
 
    <p>
        Rubber roofing products are resilient against pests, freezing weather conditions, fire, and wind 
        damage. RuBBur shingles are rated Class A for <a href="/definitions/fire_ratings.html">fire resistance</a>,
        and are UV-resistant.
