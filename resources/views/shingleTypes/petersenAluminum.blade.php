    <p>
        Petersen Aluminum coats their sheet metals in Kynar-500®
        or Hylar-5000®, which they claim make the metal ideal for roofing. Their Snap-Clad roofing 
        panels may be ordered in aluminum, copper, stainless or galvanized steel, with a smooth or 
        stucco-type finish. Other lines include Tite-Loc and Tite-Loc Plus. Snap-On Panels are for 
        roofs that have a steep pitch or several transitions, and require flat, strong sub-roofing. The 
        other model they sell is Redi-Roof, which requires a plywood or nailboard insulation base and a 
        roof with a pitch of at least 3:12.
