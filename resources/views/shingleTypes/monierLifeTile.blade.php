    <h3>Product Lines</h3>
    <p>
        <b>MonierLifetile</b> is a manufacturer of concrete roof tile products and components. They produce both standard-weight 
        and lightweight shingles. Both are available in a variety of colors, patterns, textures, and shapes. The 
        standard-weight tile shingle is used in new construction and reproofing projects.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Lightweight tile shingles meet the 6-pound per square foot standard. These shingles are not available in all regions as 
        they are not made for extreme weather conditions. The tiles are molded into shapes that mimic traditional roofing 
        products, such as slate tiles and shake panels. MonierLifetile shingles are available in the following product lines:
