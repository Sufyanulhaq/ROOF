    <p>
        Berridge Manufacturing Co. makes architectural metal panels and shingles for commercial and residential applications. Berridge uses a unique 
        patented process that presses metal sheets into a series of folds and patterns. In large, commercial applications, panels can be formed 
        to the proper degree of curvature needed to roof any building. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Corporate History</h3>
    <p>
        Berridge Manufacturing Co. was founded in 1970 by Jack Berridge, a graduate of California Polytechical Institute. In 1986, Berridge developed 
        a unique process for fabricating both flat and curved panels of metal on a jobsite. Today, the company manufactures and licenses ten lines 
        of rollforming machinery, in addition to its roofing products. The company has seven manufacturing facilities and distributes its products 
        across the world. 
    </p>
    <h3>Products</h3>
    <p>
        Berridge categorizes its roofing products in part by the seaming process. Its roofing products for commercial and residential applications 
        include: Cee-Lock Standing Seam Roof Panel; Curved, Compound Curved and Tapered Tee-Panel; Standing Seam Zee-Lock; and Batten Seam Panel. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Berridge shingles for residential applications include the S-Tile System, Classic Shingle, Victorian Shingle, Rustic Shake Shingle and 
        Fish Scale Shingle. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Berridge shingles are made of metal, usually Galvalume or galvanized steel. Individual patterns are stamped onto the shingles. The shingles 
        imitate the appearance of standard shingles, but are lighter, long-lasting, and algae- and fire-resistant, according to the manufacturer. 
        The company also notes that many of its product include high level of recycled materials and lower the heat island effect.
