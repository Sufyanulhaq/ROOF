    <p>
        DECRA Roofing Systems manufactures several lines of stone-coated <a href="/shingles/metal.html">metal shingles</a>. These 
        shingles resemble architectural shingles: tile, shake and asphalt shingles.  DECRA 
        uses a zinc/aluminum-coated steel with an acrylic bonded layer of natural crushed stone. 
        The stone gives the shingles a color finish that resembles traditional materials. These 
        stone-coated shingles resist sun fading, UV rays, rot, and moss infestation. According to the manufacturer, the metal 
        shingles weigh less than traditional roofing products and offer greater longevity.

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        DECRA Roofing Systems is the North American division of New Zealand's Fletcher Building Co. The company's process of stone-coating steel roofs was 
        inspired during WWII by the repair of bomb-damaged buildings with corrugated tin roofs. The shiny surface of the tin was disguised from overhead 
        planes by an application of tar and stone. After the war, the tin was inspected and found to have weathered the war years with virtually no 
        weather-related decay. This product line has evolved over the years into the company's present roofing system. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Fletcher Building Co. was founded in the early 20th century and is today one of New Zealand's largest building product manufacturers. In 2012, 
        Fletcher's Building Products Division, of which DECRA is a part, earned annual sales of approximately $558 million USD.

    <h3>DECRA's Warranty</h3>
    <p>
        DECRA Shingles carry a 50-year limited liability. The warranty is transferable within the first 10 years of installation and covers the shingles 
        against manufacturer's defects, resistance to wind of 120 miles per hour and resistance to hail damage. If the shingles are defective, they will 
        be covered for individual replacement cost for the first 20 years and on a prorated basis for the remainder of the period. As with all shingles, 
        we recommend you thoroughly review the warranty.
