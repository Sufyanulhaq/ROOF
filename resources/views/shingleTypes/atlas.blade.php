        Atlas Roofing Corp. manufactures several lines of shingles, as well as other roofing products and sheathing insulation, at facilities worldwide. 
        It offers roofing products for both residential and commercial applications.
    </p>
   
    <h3>Corporate History</h3>
    <p>
        Atlas Roofing Corp. began production of asphalt shingles in Meridian, Miss.,, in 1982. Since then, Atlas has expanded its manufacturing efforts 
        to 17 facilities throughout North America and its product offerings worldwide. The company has four divisions: Residential, Commercial, Web 
        Technologies and Atlas EPS.
    </p>
    <p>
        Atlas' product line also includes foam insulations. Atlas acquired Falcon Foam (producers of foam insulation) from 
        <a href="/shingles/brands/owens-corning.html">Owens Corning</a> in 2000.  Falcon now markets that product under the Atlas EPS name. 
    </p>
    <h3>Product Lines</h3>
    <p>
        Atlas offers two distinct categories of shingles: architectural and 3-tab. Architectural shingles feature a three-dimensional design. These 
        shingles are made of more than one layer of material, which enhances the overall appearance of the shingle and makes it more closely resemble 
        a natural shake or slate shingle. The extra layers are often composed of layers of laminate. Atlas makes architectural shingles under the 
        following product lines: Pinnacle, StormMaster, ProLAM and GlassMaster. Many of the company's shingles feature Scotchguard for algae resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Three-tab shingles have two notches cut into the lower edge of the shingle. This gives the shingle the appearance of being three smaller 
        shingles, instead of one large shingle. Atlas makes 3-tab shingles under the GlassMaster and Tough-Glass brand names.

    <h3>Warranty</h3>
    <p>
        Warranties on Atlas shingles vary by product line. Consumers can select shingles that carry anywhere from a 30-year to lifetime limited warranty. 
        Some of the shingles also carry an "algae resistance" warranty. In general, the warranties are as follows: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The warranties cover manufacturer's defects and will offer replacement materials 
    	for damage, not covering labor costs. They do not cover damage that is a result 
    	of: improper installation, poor roof ventilation, home settling, improper 
    	maintenance, or acts of God (hurricanes, earthquakes, lightning, wind speeds 
    	in excess of stated warranty).</li>
        <li>The warranty covering algae-related damage applies only to algae-resistant 
    	shingles (ARS). ARS-treated shingles are warranted for 10 years against algae. </li>
        <li>Each warranty covers wind damage for winds up to the specified mph in the initial warranty. Wind warranties are valid for 5 to 15 years from 
    	the initial installation, depending on the product.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Review your product warranty carefully to make sure you understand the terms.
