    <p>
        Classic Metal Roofing Systems offers metal interlocking roofing systems designed to provide 
        energy efficiency. The company claims that the shingles are water-tight and resistant 
        to wind blow-offs and the weight of accumulated snowfalls.
    </p>
    <p>
        The shingles have a Kynar/Hylar coating that 
        consists of pigments designed to be more sun-reflective.
    </p>
 
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        Classic Metal Roofing began in 1980, when founder Don Miller acquired the Rustic shingle from Kaiser Aluminum and Classic Metal Roofing Systems. 
        The company expanded its initial focus on commercial buildings to include roofing products for homes as well. The company is a division of Isaiah 
        Industries Inc. in Piqua, Ohio.
    </p>
    <h3>Product Lines</h3>
    <p>
        The company's high-end product is named Rustic Shingle, a metal shingle designed to look like expensive wood shakes. Other products include Country 
        Manor Shake, which offers the look of wood shakes; GrandeTile, which mimics barrel tile roofs; the Oxford shingle, for the aesthetics of 
        architectural shingles; and ClickLock premium standing seam for homeowners who like the look of a standing seam.
