    <p>
        Custom Bilt Metal (CBM) offers several types of metal roofing shingles. The 
        <a href="/shingles/brands/vail-metal-systems.html">Vail</a> Titan Select is made from heavy-gauge steel, while the Vail Majestic 
        Copper Shingle is manufactured of solid copper, while the Country Manor shakes are made from aluminum. A full line of classically 
        styled standing seam roofing products also is available.

        The company claims that its metal roofing shingles hold up in heavy weather conditions, such as heavy snow or high winds. It also 
        claims that these products don't require maintenance.
