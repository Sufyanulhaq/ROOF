    <p>
        Vande Heigh Raleigh produces high-end concrete roofing tiles in their Wisconsin 
        manufacturing plant. Each tile is hand-crafted. Their tiles work especially well 
        in intense climate conditions, as they don't degrade. They are fire resistant with a 
        Class A (highest) <a href="/definitions/fire_ratings.html">fire rating</a>. 
        According to the company, their product meets or exceeds industry standards for 
        durability, wind, moisture absorption, and weight. They have a number of styles, 
        including:
    </p>

    <p>
        Custom Brushed -- Surfaces are coated by hand and feature antiquing, moisture 
        marking, and weathering. The surfaces are slightly damaged in order to artistically reflect light.
    </p>
    <p>
        Shake -- Roughly finished with raw edges to simulate the look of a wooden shake. Custom 
        raking further enhances the wood-like appearance. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Cotswold -- This is a classic model that replicates the roofs seen on manor houses and 
        English churches. The desired appearance is achieved by dimpling and varying the colors 
        in each tile.
    </p>
    <p>
        High Barrel Tile -- This tile is seen most often in the southwest in the traditional adobe 
        clay color, but can be treated in a variety of colors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Riviera -- The Riviera mimics the style of Mediterranean roofs continually exposed to 
        sunlight. 
    </p>
    <p>
        English Shingle -- This small tile, available in smooth or textured surfaces, is used for 
        complete roofing or to accessorize specific areas such as bowed windows or additions.
