    <p>
        Prior to its acquisition by <a href="/shingles/brands/gaf.html">GAF Materials Corp.</a>, Elk offered five patented brand names of asphalt shingles. 
        These included Prestique®, Raised Profile, Domain® Winslow®, and Capstone®. The"legacy" brands have since been discontinued by GAF Materials, 
        although some information about these products is still available from GAF. 
    </p>
   
    <p>
        Elk claimed its lamination made its product, at 1/2-inch, twice as thick as others on the market. The base was UltraMat® reinforced fiberglass, whih
        aided in preventing damage from fire, rot and warping. The WindGuard® sealant helped protect Elk shingles from wind blow-off.

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        ElkCorp. began roofing shingle production in 1955. 
        In 2007, Elk was acquired by GAF Materials Corp. For some time after the acquisition the two lines remained separate, 
        but GAF has since discontinued most Elk brands. 
    </p>
    <p>
        GAF was founded in 1886 and, as of a 2010 Freedonia Group study, was North America's largest manufacturer of commercial and residential roofing. The company 
        regularly earns nearly $3 billion in annual sales.
