    <h1>Vinyl Roofing</h1>
    <p>
	Polyvinyl chloride, more commonly known as vinyl roof membrane, is an inexpensive roofing solution that boasts
	improved energy efficiency for homes on which it is installed.  Vinyl membrane is typically used on low-slope roofs.
    </p>
 
    <h3>Benefits of Vinyl Roofing</h3>
    <p>
	Vinyl membranes are usually a light color such as tan, grey, or white. As a result, the material reflects heat
	away from buildings which improves energy efficiency. In addition, vinyl roofing can be recycled making it an
	environmentally friendly product. 
    </p>
    <p>
	Vinyl roofing can be installed at any time of the year as the heat-welded seams ensure the product is securely
	bounded together. The materiel is light, flexible and easy to work with, and there is little to no maintenance
	required over the life of the product. Vinyl roofing is designed to repel dirt and resist structural movement and
	wind uplift. 
    </p>
    <h3>Durability</h3>
    <p>
	The durability of vinyl roofing depends on the installation and design of the system but generally vinyl roofs can
	last for over 25 years. In addition, vinyl roofs are fire resistant.
    </p>
    <h3>Common Problems</h3>
    <p>
	Vinyl the roofing should be inspected every six months or after any major weather event for signs of any damage or
	problems. 
    </p>
    <h3>Vinyl Roofing Ratings</h3>
    <p>
	In 1999, 13 roofing membranes, including vinyl, were tested by an independent engineering firm. Based on 31
	criteria (in accordance with ASTM D-4434), seven of the eight vinyl samples scored higher - up to 57 percent
	higher - than the other materials. In addition, vinyl has a broader range of fire ratings when compared to other
	materials, and due to the heat-welding process, are less weather-sensitive.
