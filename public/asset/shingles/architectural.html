    <h1>Architectural Roofing Shingles</h1>
    <p>
	Architectural shingles are also known as laminated or dimensional shingles. They are among the highest quality roofing products because they are heavier, without requiring 
	additional support under the roof. They are used by homeowners, usually of large houses, who like a distinctive look to their roofs. Their weight and design give a 
	three-dimensional appearance. Some are nailed on in the usual way, while others in addition to nails, have interlocking tabs. They are also attractive to builders because 
	of ease of installation.

    <h3>How are Architectural Shingles made?</h3>
    <p>
	They are made using a heavier mat base than a standard <a href='/shingles/asphalt.html'>asphalt</a> shingle. The mat base is made from fiberglass or organic materials, with 
	some asphalt added. The back of the shingles are coated with a special material and granules are added to the top layer.

    <h3>How long do Architectural shingles last?</h3>
    <p>
	In most cases they're designed to last for 30-50 years. They contain asphalt and minerals, are strong and flexible. They withstand extreme temperatures and other weather events. 
	They are often available with a lifetime warranty.

    <h3>Common problems with Architectural Shingles</h3>
    <p>
	Architectural shingles may be subject to algae and mildew damage if wet leaves and other materials build up. If you live in an area subject to these conditions consider this 
	type of shingle with some copper included in the materials.

    <h3>Architectural Shingle Ratings</h3>
    <p>
	The heaviest are rated to withstand winds up to 120 mph, heavy hail and other impact. The interlocking models hold together extremely well. They are also highly fire resistant 
	especially if they have a heavy granulated top coat. Those with fiberglass or rubberized asphalt are rated the highest for fire and weather.
