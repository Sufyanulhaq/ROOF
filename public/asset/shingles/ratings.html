        When deciding which brand of shingles to install on your roof, you need a good roofer, some tools, and shingles that represent
        a good value relative to their cost.  An important element of that value is the quality of those shingles.

        Roof.info has been collecting 
        consumer reviews of shingles since 2009.  In addition to a description of what they like and dislike about their shingles, homeowners
        also rate their satisfaction from 5 (very satisfied) to 1 (very unsatisfied).  These ratings are presented below: the shingles with the
        highest level of satisfaction appear first -- lower levels come later in the list.

        We have collected reviews on more than 30 different brands of roofing shingles. However, some of these brands have been excluded from the preceding list.
        If we have only collected a handful of reviews, we run the risk that a single homeowner might affect the average rating too far in one direction or 
        another. For that reason, we have only included the average rating for brands that at least 10 consumers have reviewed. However, 
        all of our <a href='/shingles/reviews/'>shingle and roofing reviews</a> are available to the public.
