        Berridge Manufacturing Co. makes architectural metal panels and shingles for commercial and residential applications. Berridge uses a unique 
        patented process that presses metal sheets into a series of folds and patterns. In large, commercial applications, panels can be formed 
        to the proper degree of curvature needed to roof any building.

    <h3>Corporate History</h3>
    <p>
        Berridge Manufacturing Co. was founded in 1970 by Jack Berridge, a graduate of California Polytechical Institute. In 1986, Berridge developed 
        a unique process for fabricating both flat and curved panels of metal on a jobsite. Today, the company manufactures and licenses ten lines 
        of rollforming machinery, in addition to its roofing products. The company has seven manufacturing facilities and distributes its products 
        across the world.

        Berridge shingles are made of metal, usually Galvalume or galvanized steel. Individual patterns are stamped onto the shingles. The shingles 
        imitate the appearance of standard shingles, but are lighter, long-lasting, and algae- and fire-resistant, according to the manufacturer. 
        The company also notes that many of its product include high level of recycled materials and lower the heat island effect.
