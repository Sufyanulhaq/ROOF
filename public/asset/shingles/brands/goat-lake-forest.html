    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
        Red cedar shingles are considered the finest quality wooden shingles. The wood is fortified by natural oils 
        that resist deterioration. Goat Lake claims that they will cool a house in summer and retain heat during the 
        winter. Red cedar is promoted as a renewable resource and therefore environmentally friendly.

        Goat Lake's premium shingle is the Perfections line. The Premium grade is 100% clear heartwood and the #1 
        grade is 80% clear heartwood. Another shingle style, the straight-split Barnshakes, comes in premium grade 
        only. Goat Lake also manufactures "resaws" shakes. They come in various thicknesses and grades, including 
        premium, medium, and heavy.
