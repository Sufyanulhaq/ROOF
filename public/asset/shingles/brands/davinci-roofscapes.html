        <b>DaVinci Roofscapes</b>, LLC manufactures engineered polymer synthetic shingles made to look 
        like traditional slate and cedar shake shingles. These shingles are blended with fire 
        retardants and UV stabilizers.  
    </p>
    <p>
        The surface of the shingle resembles the textured appearance of slate or cedar shingles. 
        Each order of shingles (both the synthetic shake and slate) come packaged in a mix of sizes 
        and color tones to closely mimic the random quality of natural materials.

    <h3>History of DaVinci Roofscapes</h3>
    <p>
        Kansas-based DaVinci Roofscapes was founded by John Humphreys in 1999. Humphreys' family owned an asphalt shingle business. He used his 
        experience in the shingle manufacturing business to create a high-end synthetic shingle that could be used as a replacement for traditional 
        roofing materials. In 2006, private equity group TGP Investments LLC began its investment in the company, at which point DaVinci expanded 
        beyond its homeowner customer base to reach out to contractors.
