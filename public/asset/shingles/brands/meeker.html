    <h3>Shingle Product Lines</h3>
    <p>
        Cedar shingles come from the heartwood of the Western Red Cedar tree and are thinner and shorter 
        than shakes from the same tree. Meeker's cedar shakes are hand-split on one side and sawn on the 
        other, while cedar shingles are sawn on both sides. Meeker sells several types of roofing shakes, 
        including:
        <ul>
            <li>Genuine Classic: hand-split</li>
            <li>Genuine Classic Heavies: a thicker version of the Genuine Classic</li>
            <li>Premier Select Medium: have straighter grain, so they lie flatter</li>
            <li>Premier Select Heavies: a thicker version of the Premier Select Medium</li>
        </ul>

        Meeker shakes meet standards of three recognized building code organizations: International Conference 
        of Building Officials, Southern Building Code Congress International, Inc., and Building Officials 
        and Code Administrators International, Inc. They are also inspected for quality by the independent 
        National Evaluation Service to ensure conformance to the Uniform Building Code and the International 
        Building Code standards.

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        In 1942 Townsend Meeker invented a new process to manufacture hand-split cedar shakes. The Meeker 
        family still owns and operates the company in the Pacific Northwest.
