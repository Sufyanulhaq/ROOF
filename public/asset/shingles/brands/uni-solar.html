        United Solar Ovonic LLC is the world's largest manufacturer of thin film amorphous solar products. 
        In plain English, Uni-Solar makes roofing shingles that look like standard shingles, but that 
        are actually individual solar panels.  You can network these shingles together and generate
        electricity to power your house or sell back to your electrical grid!
        Uni-Solar shingles have won the prestigious Popular Science Grand Award, "Best of What's New - 
        Environmental Technology," and Discover Magazine's "Technological Innovation Award" for best 
        innovation.

        Uni-Solar shingles do not require support structures. As there is no glass, they 
        are almost unbreakable. They are shadow and heat tolerant. The flexible solar home roofing can be 
        arranged like conventional <a href='/shingles/asphalt.html'>asphalt shingles</a> to blend with the existing shingles when installed. 
        Uni-Solar products are said to deliver 20% more energy because they are less affected by temperature. 
        Each shingle uses a technology called Triple Junction solar cells. These cells are made on a roll 
        of stainless steel. Uni Solar shingles are sold through strategic partners and a worldwide distributor network.
