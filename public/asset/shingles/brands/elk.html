        Prior to its acquisition by <a href='/shingles/brands/gaf.html'>GAF Materials Corp.</a>, Elk offered five patented brand names of asphalt shingles. 
        These included Prestique®, Raised Profile, Domain® Winslow®, and Capstone®. The"legacy" brands have since been discontinued by GAF Materials, 
        although some information about these products is still available from GAF.

        Elk claimed its lamination made its product, at 1/2-inch, twice as thick as others on the market. The base was UltraMat® reinforced fiberglass, whih
        aided in preventing damage from fire, rot and warping. The WindGuard® sealant helped protect Elk shingles from wind blow-off.

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        ElkCorp. began roofing shingle production in 1955. 
        In 2007, Elk was acquired by GAF Materials Corp.</a> For some time after the acquisition the two lines remained separate, 
        but GAF has since discontinued most Elk brands. 
    </p>
    <p>
        GAF was founded in 1886 and, as of a 2010 Freedonia Group study, was North America's largest manufacturer of commercial and residential roofing. The company 
        regularly earns nearly $3 billion in annual sales.
