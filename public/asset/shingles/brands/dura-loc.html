        Dura-Loc Roofing Systems, now known as Allmet, makes metal roofing systems for steep-slope commercial and residential buildings.

        According to the manufacturer, Allmet <a href='/shingles/metal.html'>metal shingles</a> weigh far less than the traditional roofing materials. 
        Today, Allmet offers eight shingle styles: Ridgewood and Wood shake shingles; Talavera and Continental barrel tiles; Tudor and Shadowline 
        slate tile; and Granite Ridge and Guardian asphalt-style shingles. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Allmet shingles are Class A <a href='/definitions/fire_ratings.html'>fire-resistant</a>, Class 4 <a href='/definitions/hail_ratings.html'>hail-rated</a>
        and warranted against high strength winds. Allmet makes its shingles in 22 different color options. Several metal shingles feature Energy StarÂ®-qualified
        finishes.
