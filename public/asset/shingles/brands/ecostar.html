        EcoStar&trade; manufactures a line of synthetic shingles that look like traditional slate and cedar shingles. These shingles are used on 
        residential and commercial buildings, particularly buildings with steep slopes that require traditional roofing materials. EcoStar uses a 
        special blend of recycled rubber and plastic to make a lightweight, durable tile as an alternative to traditional roofing materials. All 
        EcoStar products offer Class 4 impact resistance.

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        EcoStar's origins date to the 1970s when the Staroba family developed the formula for the Staroba Alloy, known as Starloy.According to the company, 
        this is a special blend of recycled rubber and plastic at the base of the injection-molded roofing tiles the company sells today. Staroba Plastics 
        first used its alloy to manufacture tiles in 1993. In 1998, EcoStar Inc. was launched for the exclusive sale of these tiles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Carlisle SynTec Inc. purchased the sales and marketing divisions of EcoStar in 2001. However, in 2010 Staroba Group reacquired those divisions and 
        rebranded the roofing division as EcoStar LLC.
