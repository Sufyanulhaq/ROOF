    <h2>History in Shingle Manufacturing</h2>
    <p>
        In 1935, Corning Glass and Owens-Illinois merged their companies to pursue the 
        manufacture of glass fiber. In 1938, the joint venture became known as Owens-
        Corning Fiberglass Corporation. In 1977 they purchased the Lloyd Fry 
        Roofing Company and Trumbull Asphalt and began using their facilities to manufacture 
        Fiberglas mat-based shingles. In 1993 they elected to make only residential 
        roofing products.
