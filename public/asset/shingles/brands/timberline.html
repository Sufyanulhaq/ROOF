    <h3>Summary</h3>

        (the top safety ratings available). They make several models:

        in 1886. They are now among the largest commercial and residential roofing product 
        manufacturers in North America.

            <li>Entire roofing system is covered under two most extensive plans</li>
            <li>Installation labor varies from five years to lifetime, dependent on 
                whatever length the shingle itself is guaranteed for</li>
            <li>Workmanship is guaranteed for 12 years maximum; under basic warranty, 
                no coverage is provided</li>
