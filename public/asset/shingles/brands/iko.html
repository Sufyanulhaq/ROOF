        IKO makes and sells a number of shingle styles throughout the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some examples include: <b>Cambridge</b>, laminated to last from 30 to 50 years, depending on shingle strengths. They are a premium architectural style shingle. <b>Crowne Slate</b> shingles, which give the roof a slate appearance, but weigh less than actual rock. <b>Grandeur</b> shingles, which are fiberglass-based and one of IKO's top-of-the-line models. <b>Regency</b> shingles, which look like a genuine wood shake roof, but are laminated. <b>Royal Victorian</b> shingles, which resemble Dutch clay tiles and consist of fiberglass and asphalt. <b>Gentry</b> asphalt shingles, which come in a variety of styles and are an all-purpose shingle.

    <h3>Iko's History</h3>
    <p>
        IKO was founded in 1951 in Alberta, Canada, and began manufacturing and selling asphalt-
        soaked paper for building construction. In 1954 they began selling roofing shingles, and 
        eventually began operating in Europe. They opened their first US plant in 1979 in Wilmington, 
        Delaware.

    <h3>Warranty</h3>
    <p>
        Shingle warranties depend on the composition and strength of the individual line. Most 
        companies carry several lines with a variety of styles. IKO offers their "Iron Clad" warranty 
        to all shingles. It covers the cost of repair or replacement, including labor charges, for 
        up to five years.
    </p>
    <p>
        Terms of their standard limited warranty vary from 30, 40, to 50 years and cover wind velocity 
        ranging from 70 mph to 110 mph. All of their shingles are class "A" fire rated, the highest 
        rating in that category. 
    </p>
    <p>
        IKO shingles with algae protection are warranted for 5 to 10 years, depending on the shingle 
        brand and style.
    </p>
    <p>
        Always study the warranty carefully before you purchase roofing shingles, as terms can vary 
        and be confusing.
