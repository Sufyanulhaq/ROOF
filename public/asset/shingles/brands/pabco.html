    <h3>Products</h3>
    <p>
        There are several products in the PABCO&reg; shingle line.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pabco Premier Advantage&reg; is the most durable. The shingle has a tough fiberglass mat base 
        and is coated in protective asphalt and ceramic granules. It's made for the weather 
        conditions of the western United States. 
    </p>
        <& /comp/google_experiment.mas &>
    <p>
        The Premier&reg; shingle is made from multiple layers of laminates. Laminated shingles add 
        the look of depth to a roof. They may be applied in random patterns to increase the artistic 
        effect.
    </p>
    <p>
        PABCO's Precise&reg; is another laminated shingle designed to give the new or re-roofing project 
        a distinctive and consistent look. The mat base is fiberglass, coated with asphalt, and 
        embedded with ceramic granules. This shingle has a self-sealing strip that adheres to the roof 
        when heated by the sun. It is designed to offer extra protection from wind and other weather 
        conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        PABCO claims that their three tab shingles, although less costly offer excellent fire, wind, 
        and weather protection. They are designed to compliment any architectural style and come in 
        various colors. The models are SG-30&reg; and SG-2&reg; the SG-30 has a thicker asphalt coat.
