        Englert, Inc. is a manufacturer of metal roofing materials for both residential and commercial 
        applications. Englert uses stone-coated steel crafted into the look of traditional roofing 
        materials: shakes, tiles, or shingles. They use an acrylic-bonded stone chip finish, which is 
        adhered to the metal shingles. Englert also makes a single-seamed metal roof. The shingles 
        and the seamed metal roofs are available in several colors.

        Englert markets their shingle under the Decra brand name -- Englert Decra Shingles, Shingles Plus, 
        and Decra Shakes. The shingles resemble traditional roofing shingles, while Decra Shingles Plus 
        are thicker and provide a more dimensional look. The Shingle Plus series are used in traditional 
        construction that requires a heavier roofing appearance, such as slate or tile.

        a 50-year limited warranty that covers manufacturers' defect. The warranty is transferable one 
        time to new owners. Englert does not warrant shingles that were not correctly installed. The 
        shingles are also warranted to be resistant to winds up to 120 mph.
