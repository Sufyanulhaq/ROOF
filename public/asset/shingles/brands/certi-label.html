        Certi-Label&trade; is a label administered by the Cedar Shake and Shingle Bureau (CSSB) that qualifying cedar shingle manufacturers can apply to 
        their shingles. The CSSB is a nonprofit trade association that specifies a series of standards for cedar shingles. Shingle manufacturers that are 
        members of the CSSB, and whose shingles qualify for CSSB standards, can market their shingles with various Certi-Label trademarks. Shake products 
        are marketed as  Certi-Sawn, Certi-Split, and Certi-Ridge; standard shingles are Certigrade and Certi-Ridge; and pre-manufactured products fall 
        under the lines of Certi-Cut, Certigrade and Certi-Groove.

        Certi-Ridge shingle hip and ridge units are available in the same cuts as the Certigrade shingles. They are pre-manufactured caps for roof 
        hips and ridges.

        Customers may choose <a href='/definitions/fire_ratings.html'>fire rating</a> of "A," "B," or "C," 
        with "A" being the highest, by asking for products with the Certi-Guard fire retardant. The company also offers products covered by a
        Certi-Last&reg; treatment, which is designed to better preserve the shingles.

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        The Cedar Shake and Shingle Bureau (CSSB) recommends using Certi-Label shingles. CSSB is a non-profit organization that was formed in 1915 
        as a branch of the Trustees of the West Coast Lumber Manufacturers Association. In 1963, CSSB merged with the Handsplit Shake Bureau to become 
        the Red Cedar Shingle and Handsplit Shake Bureau. The organization's current name dates to 1988. 
    </p>
    <p>
        CSSB functions to ensure that quality cedar products are used in all aspects of building construction. The bureau answers questions for the 
        public, building code officials, architects and others. It also subcontracts mill quality control inspections to third-party quality control 
        agencies.
