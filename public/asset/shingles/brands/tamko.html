        Tamko&reg; Roofing Products makes several lines of roofing products for residential and 
        commercial applications. Tamko focuses on producing shingles and roofing products from 
        man-made materials that most closely resemble natural shingle products, like slate and 
        shake shingles.

        composite shingles made to look like slate or shake shingles; Metalworks&reg; Steel 
        shingles, lightweight metal shaped to mimic slate, wood and tile; Heritage&reg; 
        Series shingles, laminated asphalt shingles in a variety of colors, styles and cuts.

        Tamko also manufactures other roofing products, including: a white roof coating to 
        reflect sun rays and keep interior temperatures low and a roll roofing product under 
        the product name Awaplan&reg;. Tamko also makes a line of composite decking and 
        railing products. The products are marketed under the EverGrain&reg; label.

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        Tamko Roofing Products was started by E.L. Craig in 1944 in Joplin, Missouri. Craig 
        focused on developing residential and commercial roofing products and selling throughout 
        the southern states. Tamko has remained a family business for three generations. Each 
        generation of family leadership has altered and refined the vision of the company. 
    </p>

        Tamko expanded their product line, their manufacturing facilities and their sales 
        territory. Before long, Tamko had plants in Kansas, Maryland, Tennessee, Alabama, and 
        Texas. Tamko maintains their corporate headquarters in Joplin, Missouri, with branch 
        sales offices scattered throughout the United States.
