        Hi-Tek Rubber, Inc. manufactures a line of shingles that is marketed and sold by RuBBur&trade;
        Concepts. RuBBur shingles are compression-molded shingles made from recycled tires. The primary 
        material is EPDM, a rubber that is resistant to extreme high and low temperatures. The shingles, 
        available in 2 colors, are formed into textured panels that resemble slate and cedar shake shingles.
