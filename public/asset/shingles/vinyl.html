	away from buildings which improves energy efficiency. In addition, vinyl roofing can be recycled making it an
	environmentally friendly product.

	Vinyl roofing can be installed at any time of the year as the heat-welded seams ensure the product is securely
	bounded together. The materiel is light, flexible and easy to work with, and there is little to no maintenance
	required over the life of the product. Vinyl roofing is designed to repel dirt and resist structural movement and
	wind uplift.

	criteria (in accordance with ASTM D-4434), seven of the eight vinyl samples scored higher - up to 57 percent
	higher - than the other materials. In addition, vinyl has a broader range of fire ratings when compared to other
	materials, and due to the heat-welding process, are less weather-sensitive.
